<h6>A HashLink bytecode disassembler, inspector, and writer.</h6>

Dashlink, stylized as **dashlink**, is a disassembler for [HashLink](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink) bytecode developed with the goal of allowing users to dump HL bytecode, rewrite compiled code, and create compiled bytecode from scratch -- all through the power of a Haxe library.
